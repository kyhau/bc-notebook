The computing power and randomness required to obtain the solution of the problem prevents having rogue agents fully
controlling the Blockchain. Essentially, the more computer power you own, the faster you can compute the PoW.

But there’s a catch: Every 2016 blocks (around two weeks), the network checks how fast the miners have worked. If
they’ve mined blocks faster than expected, it means the miners have increased their computational power.

To prevent this from happening and tipping the balance, the network modifies the difficulty of the PoW and increases it
so the average time to solve it remains at **10 minutes**.
