Distributed Ledger Technology is an umbrella term used to describe technologies which distribute records or information
among all those using it, either privately or publicly.

As the cryptoworld continues to grow and change, we’re seeing not only the creation of several variations of the
original Bitcoin blockchain, but also DLT systems which have ditched the idea of a blockchain altogether, such as 
- [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/) and the Tangle Network,
- [Hashgraph](https://www.hedera.com/),
- RaiBlocks (now [NANO](https://nano.org/en)), and
- [peaq](https://www.peaq.io/page.html).
