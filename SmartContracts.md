# Smart Contracts

https://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/smart-contract 

- A smart contract, also known as a cryptocontract , is a computer program that directly controls the transfer of
  digital currencies or assets between parties under certain conditions. 
- A smart contract not only defines the rules and penalties related to an agreement in the same way that a traditional
  contract does, but it can also automatically enforce those obligations.

- Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly
  written into lines of code.
- The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. 
- Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties
  without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions
  traceable, transparent, and irreversible.
