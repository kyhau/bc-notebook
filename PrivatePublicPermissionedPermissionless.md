- **Permissionless Blockchain**:
   - Every node in the network participate in consensus procedure.
   - Examples: Bitcoin Blockchain (Proof of Work)

- **Permissioned Blockchain**: 
   - Only selected nodes (validators, e.g. Government or trusted nodes) participate in consensus procedure.
   - Examples: Hyperledger Blockchain

- **Public Blockchain**:
   - Anyone in the world can download the data and read the data.
   - Anyone can participate in the consensus process to write the data or block into the public blockchain.
   - It is highly secured using cryptography and consensus protocol.
   - Examples:  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Lisk, Factom, Blockstream

- **Consortium Blockchain**:
   - Consortium Blockchain is controlled by a consortium of members. It has pre-defined set of nodes, the users with
     access to write the data or block. For example, in the case of Trade Finance use case, the consortium may be
     participating banks, importer, exporter, ports of sending and receiving countries, custom officials etc. 
     Some of these participants will have write access and some or all will have read access.
   - It is not fully decentralized as public blockchain.
   - Examples : Ripple, R3

- **Private Blockchain**:
   - In Private Blockchain, all permissions are kept centralized to an organization. Companies who wanted to create own
     currencies started using this type of Blockchain.
   - One major criticism of Private Blockchain is that since it is not decentralized, it’s just a distributed database.
     There are some points in favor of this approach.
   - One it allows some organizations who have compliance and privacy
     requirements to implement Blockchain.
   - Second, it adds the values like cryptographic auditing and known identities to the internal processes. 
   - But with private Blockchain, the central idea and beauty of decentralization and open protocols gets lost.
   - Examples :  Multichain, Blockstack
