## Why is storing Data On-Chain a Problem?

1. Storing data on the chain is expensive.
2. The amount of data we can store is quite limited.
3. Sensible Information on the Blockchain - 
   Most personal or confidential information needs to be deleted at some point. 
   Especially considering the new GDPR.
   Unfortunately, deleting data from the chain is not possible by design.
